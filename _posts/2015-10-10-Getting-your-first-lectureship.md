On Wednesday I was invited to participate in a Webinar entitled "Getting your
first lecturship". This was organised by [Cardiff
University](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/)'s [graduate
college](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/ugc/news) (UGC). The format included an
overview of recent findings from a survey conducted by the Association of
Careers Advisory Services and then a discussion including [Dr Sophie
Coulombeau](https://twitter.com/SMCoulombeau) and [Dr Claire
Shaw](http://www.bris.ac.uk/sml/people/claire-l-shaw/index.html).

You can see the recording below:

[Here is the UGC page](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/ugc/archives/8019) which
includes a pdf with a variety of hopefully useful resources.

Sophie and Claire had some excellent advice and I would really recommend
watching the video if you are at a stage of your academic career (PhD,
postdoc...) and thinking of getting a lectureship in the United Kingdom (it's
probably useful in other countries also, but we concentrated on particularities
of the UK).

Some of the particular points that stayed with me:

- Self care: it's very easy to let academia do a lot of damage. This is not
  something I'm particularly good at myself but stress and mental health is
  something that you should always keep an eye on: at whatever stage of your
  career you are.
- Selling the whole narrative: at interview it's important to find a way to think
  about what a particular post is looking for and how/why you fit that particular
  role.

What was also interesting was that we all seemed to agree that we were lucky. This was certainly the case with me, circumstances were just right and I was very lucky to have leadership that gave me a wealth of opportunities.

On a slightly related note, as I was writing this post, I thought about [Tim
Hopper's](https://twitter.com/tdhopper) great resource
[shouldigetaphd.com/](http://shouldigetaphd.com/). If you are thinking about
doing a PhD at all, perhaps take a look at the awesome case stories there...
