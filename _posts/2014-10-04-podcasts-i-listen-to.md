I've recently gotten in to podcasts again (again) and really enjoy listening to most of these in the background of whatever it is I'm doing.

The podcasts I listen to probably fall in to the following categories:

- Technology
- Science
- Sport

I'm sure I'm missing a bunch so I thought I'd write a blog post in the hope that kind readers would let me know what I should be listening to.

**Technology**

- [Tech News Today](http://twit.tv/tnt): One of many twit shows I like. I usually listen to this first thing in the morning.
- [This week in tech](http://twit.tv/twit): I really like Leo Laporte and enjoy listening to this show as background noise to whatever it is that I'm doing.
- [Linux action show](http://goo.gl/hte7a): I sometime find these guys 'defend' linux on the desktop a bit too fervently but I never fail to learn something new.
- [MacBreak Weekly](http://twit.tv/mbw): This has the same kind of vibe as 'this week in tech'.
- [All about android](http://twit.tv/aaa): Again, this one feels like hanging out with friends (the probably with real friends being that I can't work at the same time but I'm working on that).
- [Security Now](http://twit.tv/sn): Another twit podcast, this one is about security and although I miss a lot about what is talked about I still enjoy it.
- [Le Rendez-Vous Tech](http://www.patreon.com/rdvtech): A French podcast very similar to this week in tech. Probably the only bit of exercise my French still gets.
- [Healthy Hacker](http://www.healthyhacker.com/): This is probably one of my favourite podcasts. Chris talks about code but also general fitness stuff.
- [vimcasts.org](http://vimcasts.org/): Not really a podcast (low frequency) but it's on my podcast catcher so I thought I'd list it here.

**Science**

- [Freakonomics Radio](http://freakonomics.com/radio/): A great podcast, extremely well produced and often covering really interesting subjects (this one I usually try not to listen to in the background like most of the above).
- [The infinite monkey cage](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00snr0w): Another really good job. Often very funny as well as informative.
- [This week in Science](http://www.twis.org/): this is always a nice listen to as they catch up on scientific stories that happened throughout the week.
- [Pythagoras Trousers](http://www.rhysphillips.co.uk/pythagoras-trousers/): Cardiff University graduate Rhys Phillips does an excellent job with this podcast.
- [Math Ed Podcast](http://mathed.podomatic.com/): A really nice show that in every episode I've listened to was a really interesting interview of a mathematical education expert.
- [Stuff you should know](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/): Not too sure if I should put this in this category but it's a cool show where they explain a bunch of topics.

**Sport**

- [First Take](http://search.espn.go.com/espn-first-take/): I don't get to follow much US sports but I do enjoy listening to Slip and Stephen A. yell at each other.
- [Pardon the Interruption](http://sports.espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/archive?id=2406595): Same as above really (although with less yelling).
- [Fighting Talk](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0070hvs): This is a fun BBC show where sports pundits get points for being funny talking about stuff that happened in the past week.
- [Around the NFL](http://www.nfl.com/podcasts?series=aroundtheleague-podcast): I like the NFL and when I have time to listen to this one I get to find out what's happening.
- [Egg chasers podcast](http://www.eggchasers.com/): A really great weekly roundup of rugby.
- [Scrum V Radio](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/7dws): A specific podcast about Welsh rugby.

One I'm forgetting in all of that is [Relatively Prime](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/386612592/relatively-prime-series-2) which is a mathematics podcast that has just started a kickstarter campaign for a second season. I've never listened to it but though it could be worth mentioning.

**Any good ones I'm missing?**
