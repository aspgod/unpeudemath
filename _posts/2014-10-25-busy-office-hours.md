Here's my second reflective post for [Imogen Dunne's](http://vincent-knight.com/research/students/current/2014/09/30/Imogen-Dunne/) final year project (you can find the first [here]({{site.baseurl}}/pedagogy/2014/10/13/reflecting-on-a-first-week-of-learning/)).

We are now at the end of Week 4 of the course and I'm glad to say that I think overall things are going well.

- My office hours have gotten **very** busy.
This is awesome.
Students are coming to see me, genuinely having struggled with concepts and this is often a result of myself or another tutor identifying specific issues in a lab session and saying something like:

> I'll give you the tick for that but come and see me during office hours to talk about it as I think you're a bit confused there.

- I think students are understanding _now_ that the role of the 'ticks' is to help identify difficulties.
I need to do a better job next year at explaining this from the offset.
It might help to put it at the top of every lab sheet...
I'll think about this...

- Imogen's focus group went really well with 15 students participating.
I still need to carefully reflect on the particular issues that were raised.
I feel again that some need to be addressed through a better communication on my part (for example students wanted to have a list of alternative resources, there is such a list on the class site and I thought I'd mentioned it in sufficiently but I will need to do that better).

- There are a large number of tutors now and with that comes the tricky task of ensuring they understand their role.
Jason was mentioned in Imogen's focus group as doing a great job as "he didn't just give the answer but pushed students to identify their difficulties".
I need to think very carefully about how to get this across to all the tutors (I think this has been addressed for the current year).

- I've been thinking about the resources and am thinking that I might create a second set of videos.
