About a year ago I put together 21 videos showing very basic LaTeX syntax.
I used [writelatex](https://www.writelatex.com/) as the platform for those videos.

You can see that playlist of videos [here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnC5h3PY-znygZ2rYNaX7_8j2Duwh58cK).

This year I'm planning on using [SageMathCloud](cloud.sagemath.com) when I teach Sage to my first years so I thought it was probably worth showing the students LaTeX in the same environment.
**So I've just finished redo'ing the same playlist of 21 videos but this time using SageMathCloud**.

You can find that playlist [here](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnC5h3PY-znxc090kGv7W4FpbotlWsrm0):

I've put all the tex files I created in the video in a github repository so they can be easily cloned in a SageMathCloud project using the https url:
