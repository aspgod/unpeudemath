[In a previous
post]({{site.baseurl}}/other/2014/10/04/podcasts-i-listen-to/) I wrote
about the podcasts I listen to. I really need to update that as things
have changed but this post is not the update. In this post I'll discuss
some of my early thoughts as I get in to
[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).

My first real encounter of reddit was when
[u/I_feel_shy](https://www.reddit.com/user/i_feel_shy) posted a link
[to my blogpost about Clash of
clans](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashOfClans/comments/25acxw/miscsomeone_please_explain_this_in_simple_words/).
I create an account to be able to answer some questions on there but
never really stayed put.

**I think that one of the reasons for this was that I didn't stumble on
a mobile app I liked.** This changed when
[@mkbhd](https://twitter.com/MKBHD) posted a video mentioning that his
app of choice was [Relay for
reddit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=free.reddit.news&hl=en_GB).

So for about 2 months or so I've been using reddit regularly, and I
have to admit that it's become one of the first things I check whenever I get a chance. I think it's the simplicity of it all that I like.

Here are the subreddits I subscribe to (please do let me know which
ones I'm missing):

- [r/android](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/): I use an android phone and this seems to suggest neat apps, and let me know what's coming up.
- [r/AskAcademic](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/): this has a
variety of interesting discussions about Academia, with questions from
students and faculty.
- [r/askscience](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/): a nice reddit
with interesting questions that pop up, a neat one recently was ["why
can't I weigh the earth by putting a scale upside
down"](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3o82rc/why_cant_i_weigh_the_earth_by_putting_a_scale/).
- [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/): cool
data related stuff :)
- [r/education](https://www.reddit.com/r/education/): am still
undecided as to whether or not I find this a valuable subreddit. I will
wait and see...
- [r/GAMETHEORY](https://www.reddit.com/r/GAMETHEORY/): not a very busy
subbredit but everynow and then something interesting comes up.
- [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/): I've only
just joined this one. Hoping I might be able to help with some
questions but also see some neat resources etc...
- [r/math](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/): one of the mathematics
subreddits.
- [r/mathematics](https://www.reddit.com/r/mathematics/): another one :)
- [r/nottheonion](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/): if you
haven't heard of [the onion](http://www.theonion.com/) go take a look
and then this subreddit will make a lot of sense...
- [r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/): I learn a lot from
scrolling through this...
- [r/rugbyunion](https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/): I like rugby.
- [r/sagemath](https://www.reddit.com/r/sagemath/): this is the
subreddit for [Sagemath](http://www.sagemath.org/), it's not terribly
active but every now and then something cool pops up.
- [r/science](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/): a general subreddit
about science. Interesting things usually pop up here.
- [r/sysor](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysor/): this is the subreddit for
Operational Research (etc...). I've pied up and answered a question
here but otherwise have learnt a few neat things that have been going
on.
- [r/vim](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/): vim is my editor of choice
and it's nice to see things trickle through here. Today I read about
the [Goyo](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim) plugin which I'm
actually using whilst writing this post, on there.

**I'm pretty sure I'm missing out a bunch of interesting subreddits so please let me know in the comments :)**

I'm also still trying to figure out if reddit is a social network or
not. The main reason for this is that I'm not sure if it's cool to post
links to my own blog posts on there or not. I've done this one or twice
but ams still trying to figure out the correct protocol. In the mean
time I continue to read, vote and sometimes comment. It's a nice place
(I know reddit does not have this reputation but perhaps I'm just
staying in the right places...).
