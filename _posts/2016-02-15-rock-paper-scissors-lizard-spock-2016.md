This post is a brief repetition of [this post from last
year](http://vknight.org/unpeudemath/pedagogy/2015/02/13/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/)
detailing results from the 16 person knock out [Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock](http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Rock_Paper_Scissors_Lizard_Spock) tournament we played the other day.

If you are not familiar with [Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock](http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Rock_Paper_Scissors_Lizard_Spock) this is a good video that explains it:

Here is how the game went (thanks to Geraint for noting everything down and Saniya for grabbing the pictures!):

Here is a plot of the strategies played during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd rounds:

The overall strategy profile played is here:

**Exactly like last year** we are not exactly at Nash equilibria.
In fact it seems that Scissors and Rock are being played a bit more often, so someone entering in to this game should respond by playing Spock (he vaporises Rock and smashes Scissors).

Here are the strategies that at some point won a duel:

Hopefully my class found this interesting and fun.
