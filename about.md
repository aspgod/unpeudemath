My name is Vince Knight and I'm a lecturer in Operational Research at Cardiff University with interests in game theory and queueing theory. I'll be using this blog to post about various things mainly including math and software...

My personal website that I use to host my teaching and research materials can be found at [vknight.org](http://www.vknight.org/).
