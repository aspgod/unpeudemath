We (James Campbell and Vince Knight are writing this together) have been working
on implementing code in [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/) to test if a game is
degenerate or not. In this post we'll prove a simple result that is used in the
algorithm that we are/have implemented.

# What is a bi-matrix

# What is a degenerate game

# What does the literature say about it

# Our result
