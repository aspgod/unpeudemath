Last week I took part in two conferences on the subject of higher education and so here's a blog post with some thoughts and reflections.

**Monday and Tuesday: 'Workshop on Innovations in University Mathematics Teaching'**

The first conference was organised by [+Paul Harper](https://plus.google.com/+PaulHarper/posts), [Rob Wilson](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/maths/contactsandpeople/profiles/wilsonrh.html) and myself.
The conference website can be found [here](http://mathsevents.cf.ac.uk/mathedworkshop/).
The goal of this conference was to promote active learning pedagogic techniques: in particular:

- The flipped classroom;
- Inquiry Based Learning (IBL).

The plan for these two days included an almost full day of talks on the Monday and an interactive IBL session on the Tuesday.

Here's a couple of snippets from each session:

- [Robert Talbert](https://plus.google.com/+RobertTalbert) gave the opening talk describing the flipped learning environment.
    You can see his slides [here](http://roberttalbert.github.io/cardiffuniv/#/).

    I was quite nervous about Robert's talk as he's an expert in flipping classrooms and I was scheduled to talk after him.
    He gave a great talk (in fairness every single talk on the day was awesome) and here are a couple of things I noted down during his talk:

    > A flipped classroom does not imply a flipped learning environment!

    > A traditional classroom encourages the dependency of a student on the instructor.

    > Flipped learning is not just videos out of class and homework in class.

    My favourite:

    > The most important part of the flipped classroom is not what happens outside of the classroom (videos etc...) but what happens inside the classroom.

- I spoke next and you can find my slides [here](http://drvinceknight.github.io/Talks/2014-07-07-Using-a-flipped-classroom-in-a-large-programming-course-for-mathematicians/2014-07-07-using-a-flipped-classroom-in-a-large-programming-course-for-mathematicians.html#/title-slide).

    I mainly spoke about the programming course that I teach using a flipped class to our first years.
    I didn't want to go in to any details about what a flipped learning environment is as I would most certainly not have been able to do it justice after Robert's talk so I just gave an exemplar of it in practice.
    I might blog about the particular approach I used another time.

- [Toby Bailey](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/people/show?person=74) then gave an excellent talk about the flipped classroom / peer instruction that he has in place for a large class.

    One of the highlights was certainly a video of his class in which we saw students respond to a question via in class clickers and then break in to groups of 2 to discuss the particular problem and then respond once again via the clickers.
    Responses were then put up for all to see and it was great to see that students were indeed improving (you could see the distributions of clicker answers improve after the peer instruction).

    Here are a couple of other things I noted down during the talk:

    > It's not all about the lecturer.

    > The importance of getting out of the way.

    > Tell the class why you are doing it.


- [Stephen Rutherford](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/biosi/contactsandpeople/stafflist/q-t/rutherford-stephen-dr-overview_new.html) then spoke about his flipped classroom in biosciences.

    This was a great talk and it was very neat to have a non mathematical point of view.
    My first highlight from Steve's talk can be seen in the photo above.
    I think that that fundamental question ('why am I better than a book') could in fact help improve the instruction of many.

    > A flipped classroom allows some control to be put in the hands of the students.

    > The reason students are at university is to get an education and not necessarily a degree.

- We then moved on to a relaxed panel discussion about the flipped classroom, one of the things that I think was a big highlight of that was the importance of involving students in the pedagogic reasoning behind whatever approach is used in a class.

- The final 'talk' of the day was by [Chris Sangwin](http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/mec/staff/chris-sangwin.html) who talked about his Moore Method class.

    ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nn35dfS5vcE/U7qn0psfLgI/AAAAAAABN1Q/5Xo0-lxmSD0/w779-h584-no/IMG_20140707_145908.jpg)

    This was a fascinating talk as Chris clearly described the success he has had with implementing a Moore Method class.

    In particular he highlighted the importance of he role of the instructor in this framework where students are given a set of problems to work through and present to their peers (there is no lecturing in a Moore method class).

    Some highlights:

    > In 2007, after his class finished students found the book from which his problems originated and continued to work through them on their own.

    > In 2008, students set up a reading group and started to read complex mathematical topics.

- The rest of the conference was a natural continuation from Chris's talk as [Dana Ernst]() and [TJ Hitchman]() spoke about Inquiry Based Learning (a pedagogic term that encompasses the Moore method).
