Here's my third reflective post for [Imogen Dunne's](http://vincent-knight.com/research/students/current/2014/09/30/Imogen-Dunne/) final year project (you can find the first [here]({{site.baseurl}}/pedagogy/2014/10/13/reflecting-on-a-first-week-of-learning/)) and the second [here]({{site.baseurl}})/pedagogy/2014/10/25/busy-office-hours).

The course is now on the final straight as students have finished the class test which is always a bit of a milestone as they now begin to really individualise their learning experience (working on individually chosen projects etc...). As we get to this point I've got 3 specific things I've been thinking about:

1. **Class test performance**

    With over half of the scripts marked it seems like students have done quite well on what is a difficult piece of assessment.
    It seems that the performance is overall better than last year but it's too early to try and guess as to why that is.

2. **Scaffolding undergraduate tutors**

    I use second year students to tutor in the lab sessions.
    They are all students who did the course last year.
    I don't think I've done the best job explaining the roles of the tutors and this is something I need to get right next year.
    I still am very excited about using undergraduate tutors as I think it's a brilliant experience for them as it continues their learning but at the same time.
    The other (super important reason) is that I think this peer level of instruction is undoubtedly of benefit to the students on the course.

    The flipped approach used requires the tutoring to be very light touch, and more about giving feedback than giving 'help'.
    I didn't do the best job of explaining this as some undergraduate tutors felt it was their job to 'get students code to work'.
    I'll probably run a bit more of an 'expansive' training session with closer shadowing at the start.

    All the tutors have done a brilliant job and I'm very pleased, I just have to think carefully about how to best 'scaffold' and support them.

3. **Communicating the different pedagogy**

    Some students were questioning the timing of my office hours: they are after the class meeting (which is in turn after the lab session).
    I think this shows that I didn't do the best job of communicating the ideas.
    Involving the students in a discussion about the pedagogy they are experience is something I think is very important (especially when using something they might not have experiendds before).
    As such I have tried and continue to try to talk about this throughout my interactions with students (from 1 to 1 meetings all the way to class meetings) but perhaps I could do more...
