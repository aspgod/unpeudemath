This academic year [+Imogen Dunne]() (a final year student here at Cardiff University) is doing her final year project looking at evaluating student attitudes in my "Computing for Mathematics" course.

The idea is to use questionnaires, focus groups and interviews to evaluate (longitudinally) mathematics students' attitudes towards:

- Learning to code;
- Learning some early mathematics;
- Learning in a flipped class environment.

This has started off well, and last week Imogen kicked off a meeting with me by giving me homework.
Something along the lines of:

> I'd like to see the attitudes of everyone involved from every point of view. Could you perhaps write a diary/log at certain points during the year, describing how you feel things are going?

I was delighted with this idea and thought that I might as well blog these reflections, so here it goes:

**A good first week.**

The first thing I will say is I think this first week went really well.
Students turned up to their lab sessions having almost universally carried out all the required work which was awesome.
There was one major change with last year shifting some of the content from each week to the next.
This had the major effect of making the first week a bit lighter which I think has had a positive effect.

**Some labs could have been a bit 'noisier'.**

I want labs sessions to be noisy spaces with students talking to each other and figuring things out.
This happened in most of the lab sessions I got to see but there was one or two where it felt more like a high school class from when I was still in high school: _students looking at me as if I was a teacher evaluating whatever they were saying_.
I'm using 2nd year students as tutors this year (which I'm super excited about: more about that later) and perhaps I need to do a better job explaining exactly what it is that I want the labs to be.
I think this has now been addressed.

**The best flipped class meeting I've ever had.**

I strive for a student centred learning environment.
This isn't always easy to obtain but the first class meeting went extremely well.
I came in expecting to talk about the `index` method no strings (which allows...
