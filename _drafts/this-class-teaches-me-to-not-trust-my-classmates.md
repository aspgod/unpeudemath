On Monday, in class we played an iterated prisoner's dilemma tournament.
I have done this many times (both in outreach events with [Paul Harper](http://www.profpaulharper.com/) and in this class).
This is always a lot of fun but none more so than last year when Paul's son Thomas joined us.
You can read about that one [here](http://drvinceknight.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/iterated-prisoners-dilemma-tournament.html).

The format of the game is as close to that of Axelrod's original tournament as I think it can be.
I split the class in to 4 teams and we create a round robin where each team plays every other team at 8 consecutive rounds of the prisoner's dilemma:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
(2,2) & (5,0)\\
(0,5) & (4,4)\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The utilities represent 'years in prison' and over the 3 matches that each team will play (against every other team) the goal is to reduce the total amount of time spent in prison.

Here are some photos from the game:

Here are the scores:

We see that 'team name' acquired the least total score and so they won the collection of cookies etc...

At one point during the tournament, one team actually almost declared a strategy which was cool:

> We will cooperate until you defect at which point we will reevaluate

This was pretty cool as I hadn't discussed at all what a strategy means in a repeated game (ie I had not discussed the fact that a strategy in a repeated game takes count of both play histories).

Here are all the actual duels:

You'll also notice at the end that a coalition formed and one team agreed to defect so that they could share the prize.
This happens about 50% of the time when we play this game but I never cease to be amused by it.
Hopefully everyone found this fun and perhaps some even already agree with a bit of feedback I received on this course last year:

(Big thanks to Jason for keeping track of the scores and to Geraint for helping and grabbing some nice pictures)
