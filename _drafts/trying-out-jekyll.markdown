So I finally decided to try out `jekyll`. I mist say that I'm really impressed: it's so light weight!

I looked at various tutorials and as I'm planning on deploying this (and possibly moving my [blog](http://drvinceknight.blogspot.co.uk/)) using github I took a look at theirs *but* it seemed a little tricky so I just followed the actual [`jekyll` tutorial](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).

The first step was to install `jekyll`:

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install jekyll
{% endhighlight %}

Then I created the base site for my blog:

{% highlight bash %}
$ jekyll unpeudemath
{% endhighlight %}
