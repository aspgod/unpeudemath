This post if very late but I have been very busy with some really exciting things.
I will describe some of the data gathered in class when we played against a random strategy played by a computer.
I have recently helped organise a conference in [Namibia](www.python-namibia.org) teaching Python.
It was a tremendous experience and I will write a post about that soon.

We played against a modified version of matching pennies which we have used quite a few times:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
(2,-2) & (-2,2)\\
(-1,1) & (1,-1)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

I wrote a sage interact that allows for a quick visualisation of a random sample from a mixed strategy.
You can find the code for that [at the blog post I wrote last year]().

I handed out sheets of papers
